# Expectations

- The talk doesn't learn you Kotlin in a methodological way but rather tries to show you how beautiful is Kotlin to get
  interested.
- I won't talk about the syntax because I assume that you will be able to understand the syntax yourself. I will show more complex
  syntax constructs gradually during the talk. But feel free to stop me and ask questions!
- Don't hesitate to ask questions during the presentation

# Demo

# Kotlin is much bigger than I showed you!

- Kotlin Multiplatform!
- Asynchronous programming with Kotlin coroutines!
- Kotlin compiler plugins
  - Reactive UI with Jetpack Compose!
  - Multiplatform reflectionless (and thus fast) serialization with kotlinx.serialization!
- Polished tooling!
- And more!
