# Demo

- The talk doesn't learn you Kotlin in a methodological way but rather tries to show you how beautiful is Kotlin to get
  interested.
- I won't talk about the syntax because I assume that you will be able to understand the syntax yourself. I will show more complex
  syntax constructs gradually during the talk. But feel free to stop me and ask questions!
- Don't hesitate to ask questions during the presentation
